Welcome to **Project Babbage**, a project to meet new tech-savvy people and explore a hot subject over a weekend.
Eventually, we want to create a growing community of people that support each other and can implement new ideas, build products (and perhaps companies) together.

We do that in the form of editions, which are:

- IRL events happening one to two times a year.
- centered around a theme (e.g. `blockchain`, `ray tracing`, `machine learning`..)
- taking place in a comfy AirBnB not too far from Paris. Everything is taken care of by the _hosts_.

## ðŸ“… Upcoming Edition

- **Edition 6**: TBD


## ðŸŽ‰ Past Editions

- **Edition 5**: (_May 8-9, 2024_): [YouShallNotPass](https://github.com/ProjectBabbage/YouShallNotPass) ðŸ”¥ðŸ¤–

  - **Theme**: Configure a LLM with a preprompt giving it a password. It shall not reveal the password when being prompted by the user!  (list participants, check repo + non commiters!)
  - **X Participants**: [arthurescriou](https://github.com/arthurescriou) [QGarchery](https://github.com/QGarchery) [mlgarchery](https://github.com/mlgarchery) [DemiBSel](https://github.com/DemiBSel) [npasquie](https://github.com/npasquie) nnalpon toumz

- **Edition 4** (_May 27-29, 2023_): [Vox nuntius](https://github.com/ProjectBabbage/vox-nuntius) ðŸ“œ

  - **Theme**: We made a video game with the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org)! It is a 2D RTS game where you send order via messengers, and the units you control only start executing the order once they receive it, so everything is delayed! And you have to send messengers at the right moment, or cut off the enemy messengers to win!
  - **7 Participants**: [QGarchery](https://github.com/QGarchery), [mlgarchery](https://github.com/mlgarchery), [GabrielAstieres](https://github.com/GabrielAstieres), [abaudhuin](https://github.com/abaudhuin), [npasquie](https://github.com/npasquie), [gaetanbrison](https://github.com/gaetanbrison), [blandinegy](https://www.instagram.com/blandinegy/)

- **Edition 3** (_October 20-21, 2022_): [MLIM](https://github.com/ProjectBabbage/mlim) âˆ‘

  - **Theme**: MLIM (Machine Learning IMproved). We wanted to make a tool that allows you to write math formulas and execute them as code, specifically targeting machine learning.
  - **6 Participants**: [QGarchery](https://github.com/QGarchery), [mlgarchery](https://github.com/mlgarchery), [Djou-ECP](https://github.com/Djou-ECP), [DemiBSel](https://github.com/DemiBSel), [GabrielAstieres](https://github.com/GabrielAstieres), [42Buck](https://github.com/42buck)

- **Edition 2** _(March 12-13, 2022)_: [babbagecoin](https://github.com/ProjectBabbage/babbagecoin) â‚¿

  - **Theme**: We made a Proof of Work Blockchain in Python with a little web interface to send and receive coins.
  - **4 Participants**: [QGarchery](https://github.com/QGarchery), [mlgarchery](https://github.com/mlgarchery), [Djou-ECP](https://github.com/Djou-ECP), [YohannLeFaou](https://github.com/YohannLeFaou)

- **Edition 1** (_June 11-12, 2021_): [render3d](https://github.com/ProjectBabbage/render3d) ðŸŽ†
  - **Theme**: We implemented a ray tracing algorithm (using Go, not the best language for this, but it was fun! And btw Go is really a quick to pick up language). The result is a 3D render of a scene, with multiple colors, sources of light, shadows and glass effect.
  - **2 Participants**: [QGarchery](https://github.com/QGarchery) & [mlgarchery](https://github.com/mlgarchery) (said _hosts_)
